## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m **Anshumesh Saini**, a software engineer, full-stack developer, and freelancer. I build **interactive web applications** using **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **MySQL**, focusing on beautiful UIs, animations, and real-world apps.

- I’m currently working on cloning platforms like **Flipkart** and **YouTube**, creating animated portfolios, and improving school management systems.  
- I’m open to **creative frontend/full-stack projects** — especially those involving animations and interactivity.  
- I need support with **scaling backend systems** and applying **advanced algorithms** for efficient web applications.  
- Right now, I'm learning **Express.js**, **API integrations**, and deeper backend architecture.  
- Want to ask me about **frontend animations**, building clones of popular websites, or tips on web development? I got you.  
- **Fun fact:** I love combining coding challenges with my adventurous spirit — life’s too short for boring projects!
